RhoconnectNET_MVC4_App Sample
===

Sample of complete ASP.NET MVC4 Contact back-end application.
 
Prerequisites:

* .NET 4 framework
* Git
* ASP.NET MVC4 framework.
* Visual Studio 2010

The application uses an embedded in-memory database (Contacts.sdf). 
Using the in-memory database means there is no need to setup and run a separate database server for this application.

To run this application, build it in Visual Studio, create a deployment package (using Project --> Build Deployment Package).
Then, deploy it on the Microsoft's IIS server to run.
